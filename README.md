# Operating System Algorithms

## Process Scheduling Algorithms

- First Come, First Served ( `FCFS` )
- Shortest Job First ( **Preemptive** / **Non-Preemptive** ) ( `SJF` )
- Priority ( **Preemptive** / **Non-Preemptive** )
- Round Robin ( `RR` )

## Page Replacement Algorithms

- First In, First Out ( `FIFO` )
- Least Recently Used ( `LRU` )
- Most Recently Used ( `MRU` )
- Least Frequently Used ( `LFU` )
- Most Frequently Used ( `MFU` )
